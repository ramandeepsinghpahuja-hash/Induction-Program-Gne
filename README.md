Induction Day 8 summary
😄peer to peer lecture

On 08-08-25, the scheduled timetable for CSE-E mentioned a Chemistry lecture from 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM followed by a P2P lecture from 10:30 AM to 12:00 Noon. However, since the Chemistry teacher was busy elsewhere, both sessions were conducted as P2P lectures. During this time, a senior took the class and introduced advanced concepts of C++ programming. The session included explanations of these topics as well as hands-on coding practice, allowing students to apply what they learned in real time. This resulted in the entire morning being dedicated to strengthening C++ coding skills instead of the originally planned mix of Chemistry and P2P.

On 08-08-25, both scheduled lectures for CSE-E were conducted as P2P sessions instead of Chemistry and P2P. A senior taught advanced C++ concepts with practical coding exercises throughout the morning.
