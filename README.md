Welcome to my induction diary at GNDEC Ludhiana! Here’s how my first day went, slot by slot.

## 08:00 – 08:20 AM ☕️ Breakfast Break
We kicked off the morning with piping-hot aloo paronthe straight from the mess. The buttery layers and spicy aloo filling were the perfect wake-up call before a day full of new faces and info.

## 08:30 – 09:30 AM 🏛 Visit to Gurudwara Sahib
A calm and spiritual start—our entire batch walked over to the campus Gurudwara Sahib. The shabad kirtan filled the air, and it felt like the right way to ground ourselves before the hustle.

## 09:30 – 10:30 AM 🛋️ Snack Break
Back on campus, we refueled with pakoras, hot chai, sweet gulab jamuns and cold drinks in the open courtyard. Perfect fuel for what came next!

## 10:30 – 12:30 PM 🎤 Auditorium Session
All of us headed to the main auditorium where the faculty gave an overview of GNDEC’s history, vision and the facilities on offer. It was inspiring to see how much thought has gone into every lab and student club.

## 12:30 – 01:30 PM 🍽 Lunch in the Mess
The mess lunch hit the spot—dal, murgh curry, steamed rice and fresh salad. I also got chatting with a few seniors who shared tips on balancing academics with campus life.

## 01:30 – 03:00 PM 👩‍🏫 Department Intro (CSE)
Mentors divided us by branch. I got placed in CSE, classroom G-14:

1. **Welcome talk** by our CSE coordinator—an overview of C++ and Python courses.
2. **HOD’s address**—the big picture of CSE: labs, projects, and industry tie-ups.
3. **Club presentations** by two professors, who introduced their coding and robotics societies.

## 03:00 – 07:00 PM ⛅ Free Time & Explorations
After the formal sessions, a bunch of us went out on foot around campus—checking out the library, sports block, and cafeteria. Great chance to bond!

---

## 07:00 – 08:20 PM 🏓 Hostel Club & Dinner
We regrouped in the hostel’s common room for a friendly table-tennis match (I lost, but it was fun!). Then dinner: roti, paneer bhurji and a side of curd. Perfect end to a busy day.

## 08:20 – 11:00 PM 🌙 Late-Night Chats & Lights Out
Back in my room, we lounged and shared stories till around 11 PM, then crashed—excited for Day 2.
